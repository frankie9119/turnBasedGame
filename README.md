# turnBasedGame - Project IN PROGRESS


Small game with 2 players moving in turn. Each players has initial lifepoints and their own weapon.

At the beginning of the game, players , weapon and obstacles are placed randomly on the map. 
Then players move their character around to get new weapon (new weapon can be more or less powerful than the old one.)

If 2 players stand next to each other, they fight!
